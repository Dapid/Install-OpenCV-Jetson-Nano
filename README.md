This is the full setup of OpenCV with CUDA and cuDNN support for the Jetson Nano.<br/>

------------

## Installing OpenCV.
You must have allocated more memory than the default on your Nano.<br/>
With the regular 4 GB RAM + 2 GB swap the compilation unfortunately crashes after 2 hours at 100%
```
# check your total memory first you need at least a total of 6.5 GB!
# if not, enlarge your swap space as explained in the guide
$ free -m

$ wget https://github.com/Qengineering/Install-OpenCV-Jetson-Nano/raw/main/OpenCV-4-5-x.sh
$ sudo chmod 755 ./OpenCV-4-5-x.sh
$ ./OpenCV-4-5-x.sh
```
:point_right: Don't forget to reset your swap memory afterwards.

------------

If you want to beautify OpenCV with the Qt5 GUI you need to
- $ sudo apt-get install qt5-default
- Set the -D WITH_QT=**ON** \ (Â± line 62) in the script<br/>
 
before running the script on your Nano
